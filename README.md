# Stock-Data-ETL-with-AWS-Glue-and-Athena
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline for scraping stock market data from the web, transforming it using AWS Glue, and analyzing it using Amazon Athena. It leverages AWS Glueâ€™s Jobs and Crawlers to automate the ETL process and uses Athena to perform queries on the transformed data for further analysis.
